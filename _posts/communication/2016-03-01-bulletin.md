### Employee eBulletin
Employee bulletin emails are a flexible communication tool for informing and motivating employees. They can be used on a regular basis for status updates or for occasional communications that require special attention, such as communicating the results of an employee survey.

<p>The <span style="font-family: Times; font-weight: bold">Stratus</span> project team would like to thank the employees who took part in the survey following our recent Town Hall event. Survey results were compiled and shared with the <span style="font-family: Times; font-weight: bold">COMPANYONE</span> and <span style="font-family: Times; font-weight: bold">Stratus</span> leadership teams. This bulletin summarizes the top questions <span style="font-family: Times; font-weight: bold">COMPANYONE</span> employees have about the <span style="font-family: Times; font-weight: bold">Stratus</span> project, and how the project team will address them.</p>

<p style="margin:0;"><b>Q. Why isn’t there a plan with a clear timeline, milestones and Go Live date?</b></p>
<p><i>A. Having a clear project timeline was the top question from employees, and is the greatest concern within the <span style="font-family: Times; font-weight: bold">Stratus</span> leadership team since it has such an impact on scheduling work and personal time. However, following our recent No Go decision for two of our foreign subsidiaries, we decided to conduct an extensive review and internal audit of the project timeline. While we are making progress, we have not reached agreement on a final Go Live date. In the meantime, we are continuing with value added project activities, such as our system testing.</i></p>

<p style="margin:0;"><b>Q. Isn’t bringing all plants online at the same time (i.e., “The Big Bang) riskier than a “Waved” approach?</b></p>
<p><i>A. Big Bang and Waved approaches both involve risk. However, a Waved approach involves more risk for <span style="font-family: Times; font-weight: bold">COMPANYONE</span> due to the complexity of our current file transfer and consolidation processes. For example, consolidation of tax reporting information under a phased approach would require the added development of custom interfaces for each location and involve running <b>Legacy</b> and <b>NewSystem</b> in parallel compromising our ability to meet reporting deadlines.</i></p>

<p style="margin:0;"><b>Q. Can we get more “hands on” classroom-based training at the plant level?</b></p>
<p><i>A. There is no substitute for “hands on” system experience and we are adjusting our training approach accordingly. For our end users, we will use a classroom based approach that offers hands on practice with <b>NewSystem</b> transactions. In addition, we are tailoring training materials according to the unique changes occurring at each location.</i></p>
