### Go Live Countdown Emails
Go Live countdown communications are the culmination of an effective communication campaign. Countdown Emails are an effective tool to cut through information overload when time and attention are at a premium. When effectively written, countdown Emails can be saved for future reference or printed out and used as a job aid.
