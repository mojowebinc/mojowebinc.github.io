#### How to Prepare

**How Much time to Allow**\\
There is a three-to-one rule in preparing to teach. You should spend three times the amount of time preparing as compared to the time it takes to teach. That means for each day of courseware you teach, spend three days of work preparing.

**Read the material**\\
Read all the materials. However, it is important that you bring your own experience and insights to the material. Therefore as you go through the material, read the instructor notes and add your own personal notes. Think in terms of what you would feel comfortable saying. If you do not understand any slide, and the instructor notes do not clear it up, contact the Training Delivery Team for clarification.

**Practice as much as Possible**\\
You should practice what  you would say on a given slide. Practice the rhythm and timing.

<hr style="width:33%; text-align:center; margin: 50px auto 50px auto;">

#### At the Start of Class - Before Students Arrive

Arrive early, about an hour before class starts. Part of being ready to train is avoiding being rushed or disorganized. If you arrive too close to the beginning of the class, you will not have time to get in the right frame of mind. The following things should be done prior to class:

**Media**\\
Check that the projector, as well as any other technology, is properly working. Make sure that you have an extra bulb for the projector in case you burn one out.

**Support Materials**\\
Make sure that you have all materials available that are listed for the course:
* Multiple flip charts
* Writing materials
* etc.

**Flipchart “Welcome”**
<p style="margin:0;">Write "Welcome to the Facilitated Training Workshop" on a flipchart.</p>

  <div class="small-9 columns t30">
    <p style="margin:0;">Write "Welcome to the Facilitated Training Workshop" on a flipchart.</p>
  </div>

* Student Binder - The students' copy of the slide materials
* Note Paper - A note pad to take notes
* Pencil or Pen - To write with

<hr style="width:33%; text-align:center; margin: 50px auto 50px auto;">

**Question: Ability vs Competency**

* Values & Beliefs: delivering instruction consistent with principles and standards
* Prepare: preparing both mentally and logistically
* Present: presenting yourself and the course material
* Facilitate: employing techniques to engage and manage

Values and Beliefs
<img src="{{ site.urlimg }}99insd_man02_sld_14.JPG" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px" alt="">
#### Instructor Notes
Values and beliefs set the backdrop for the entire learning environment. Establishing sound values and beliefs during the operating agreement helps to focus the facilitator and motivate the participants.
