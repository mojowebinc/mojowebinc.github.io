<hr style="width:33%; text-align:center; margin: 50px auto 50px auto;">

#### How to Prepare

**How Much time to Allow**\\
There is a three-to-one rule in preparing to teach. You should spend three times the amount of time preparing as compared to the time it takes to teach. That means for each day of courseware you teach, spend three days of work preparing.

**Read the material**\\
Read all the materials. However, it is important that you bring your own experience and insights to the material. Therefore as you go through the material, read the instructor notes and add your own personal notes. Think in terms of what you would feel comfortable saying. If you do not understand any slide, and the instructor notes do not clear it up, contact the Training Delivery Team for clarification.

**Practice as much as Possible**\\
You should practice what  you would say on a given slide. Practice the rhythm and timing.

<hr style="width:33%; text-align:center; margin: 50px auto 50px auto;">

#### At the Start of Class - Before Students Arrive

Arrive early, about an hour before class starts. Part of being ready to train is avoiding being rushed or disorganized. If you arrive too close to the beginning of the class, you will not have time to get in the right frame of mind. The following things should be done prior to class:

**Media**\\
Check that the projector, as well as any other technology, is properly working. Make sure that you have an extra bulb for the projector in case you burn one out.

**Support Materials**\\
Make sure that you have all materials available that are listed for the course:
* Multiple flip charts
* Writing materials
* etc.

<img src="{{ site.urlimg }}99insd_man02_icon_flp.jpg" style="margin: 25px 0px 0px 0px" alt="">\\
**Flipchart “Welcome”**\\
Write "Welcome to the Facilitated Training Workshop"

**Student Materials**\\
Make sure that each student place setting includes everything the student will need for the class:
* Student Binder - The students' copy of the slide materials
* Note Paper - A note pad to take notes
* Pencil or Pen - To write with

<hr style="width:33%; text-align:center; margin: 50px auto 50px auto;">

#### Opening the Workshop

The first set of slides were designed to set the tone for the workshop and provide a high level overview of the material that will be covered.

**Welcome & Ice Breaker**\\
Greet the participants, introduce yourself. Engage the participants with an ice breaker you feel is appropriate.

**Agenda**\\
Explain the agenda for the workshop.

**Operating Agreement**\\
Explain to the participants the you and they must have a contract with each other.

**Housekeeping**\\
Talk about administrative issues, as well as general “housekeeping” such as location of the restrooms and coffee machine.

**Questions**\\
Conclude the workshop opening by having a brief question and answer session with participants.

<hr style="width:33%; text-align:center; margin: 50px auto 50px auto;">

#### Wrapping up the Workshop: Lessons Learned

There final set of slides were designed to close out the class. Provide a brief recap of the material, and conduct a question and answer session with participants.

**Wrapping Up the Workshop\: Lessons Learned**

<img src="{{ site.urlimg }}99insd_man02_icon_qst.jpg" style="margin: 25px 0px 20x 0px" alt="">\\
